# ASCII-art-logo-AI
code that generates an ASCII art logo using a simple AI-powered approach
To use this code:

Make sure you have installed the required libraries: Pillow (PIL) and pytesseract. You can install them using pip:
Copy code
pip install Pillow pytesseract
Save your logo image as "logo_image.png" in the same directory as the script, or provide the correct path to your image in the image_path variable.
Run the script, and it will output the ASCII art representation of your logo.
